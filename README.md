# Download
For non-programmers: to execute the game, just download the [JAR file above (click here)](https://github.com/jessepf/Centipede_Java/raw/master/Centipede3.jar).

**Some trivial info**: Runs on any platform with JRE/JDK installed.

# About the code
The app was developed for Game Theory coursework for 1 MA Economics students in Department of Economics, Madras Christian College, in association with Arun Koshy, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Economics, MCC.

Simple implementation of Centipede game using Java.

# Reverse Engineering Challenge
This challenge was launched to introduce the concept of "reverse engineering" to my students in Department of Mathematics, Madras Christian College. Aim is to reverse engineer this game and find how the app works - and replicate the concept. 
If you are going to take up this challenge, I would recommend you 

1. to skip the "science behind it" section below. 
2. do not read the java file in repo above
3. download the"JAR" file, execute it in and out, see what the app does.

You can read more about it [on my Lecture Diary Blog](https://mccmathnotes.wordpress.com/2017/12/11/reverse-engineering-challenge/)

# Science behind it

# Disclaimer
Well, it should just work. This is my first Java app - though I have played with Ionic/AngularJS1, BASH et al in past. This is more of a learning project for me, myself - so code might be slightly messed up.
