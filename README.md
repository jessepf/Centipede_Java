# About the code
The app was developed for Game Theory coursework for 1 MA Economics students in Department of Economics, Madras Christian College, in association with Arun Koshy, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Economics, MCC.

Simple implementation of Centipede game using Java.

This is my first Java app - though I have played with Ionic/AngularJS1, BASH et al in past.

# Reverse Engineering Challenge
This challenge was launched to introduce the concept of "reverse engineering" to my students in Department of Mathematics, Madras Christian College. Aim is to reverse engineer this game and find how the app works - and replicate the concept. If you are going to take up this challenge, I would recommend you to skip the "science behind it" section below. You can read more about it here: https://mccmathnotes.wordpress.com/2017/12/11/reverse-engineering-challenge/
